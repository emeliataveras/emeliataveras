Hi, I’m Emelia, but you can call me Emely.
I’m starting this journey that is full stack development, and might fumble along the way, but I'm ready to go with the flow of the process. I’m currently learning everything web development and following along Colt Steele's updated bootcamp on Udemy (with some help from FCC along the way.

Some short term goals I'd like to achieve: 
1. Learn enough basic front-end code to start the Full Stack Open course.
2. Be able to build an intuitive, stylish, and modern landing page from scratch.
3. Expand on that landing page into a full website design.
4. Build my first basic web app.

Long term goal: join the software engineering workforce and contribute in creating human-first apps. Who said tech and humans couldn't coexist?

I hope to reach a level where I can collaborate on any newbie projects that is artistically challenging, socially conscious, or innovative. Let's start off strong. Challenge me!
